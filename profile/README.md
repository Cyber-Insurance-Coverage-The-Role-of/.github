# **Cyber Insurance Coverage: The Role of Silverfort in Cybersecurity**

In today’s digital landscape, cyber threats are a constant concern for businesses of all sizes. Cyber insurance coverage has become an essential part of mitigating the financial and reputational damage caused by data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other cybersecurity incidents. However, effective protection goes beyond insurance policies—it also requires cutting-edge technology like Silverfort.

Unlike traditional solutions, Silverfort extends multi-factor authentication (MFA) to systems that were not initially designed to support it, including legacy applications and command-line interfaces.
